/**
  * The Hmac Class is a utility for creating cryptographic HMAC digests. It can be used in one of two ways:
  * <ul>
  * <li>As a stream that is both readable and writable, where data is written to produce a computed HMAC digest on the readable side, or</li>
  * <li>Using the hmac.update() and hmac.digest() methods to produce the computed HMAC digest.</li>
  * </ul>
  *
  * The crypto.createHmac() method is used to create Hmac instances. Hmac objects are not to be created directly using
  * the new keyword.
