/**
  * Instances of the Decipher class are used to decrypt data. The class can be used in one of two ways:
  * <ul>
  * <li>As a stream that is both readable and writable, where plain encrypted data is written to produce unencrypted data on the readable side, or</li>
  * <li>Using the decipher.update() and decipher.final() methods to produce the unencrypted data.</li>
  * </ul>
  *
  * The crypto.createDecipher() or crypto.createDecipheriv() methods are used to create Decipher instances.
  * Decipher objects are not to be created directly using the new keyword.
