/**
  * The Hash class is a utility for creating hash digests of data. It can be used in one of two ways:
  * <ul>
  * <li>As a stream that is both readable and writable, where data is written to produce a computed hash digest on the readable side, or</li>
  * <li>Using the hash.update() and hash.digest() methods to produce the computed hash.</li>
  * </ul>
  * The crypto.createHash() method is used to create Hash instances. Hash objects are not to be created directly using
  * the new keyword.
